one more&mdash;the fine, moist, tender
texture that is hard to describe by
any word except &ldquo;velvety&rdquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Velvety crumb&rdquo;&mdash;that is the expression
cake judges use in speaking
of the beautiful texture of
cakes leavened by Calumet, the
Double-Acting Baking Powder.</p>
<p>See it in this close-up picture of
a slice of Calumet cake! Then
make any cake in this book&mdash;cut
a slice and feel a crumb between
thumb and finger. Soft as velvet!
Touch the cut surface. So moist
and springy! Now taste a morsel
of the cake. Velvet-fine&mdash;velvet-smooth!</p>
<p>Every Calumet cake, plain cake
or party cake, dark or light or
golden-yellow, has this same lovely
texture&mdash;thanks to Calumet&rsquo;s dependable
Double-Action. Use the
recipes in this book, following
Calumet&rsquo;s thrifty proportion with
care, and all your cakes will be
perfect&mdash;the envy and admiration

<p>What makes a perfect biscuit?
A little flaky, crusty morsel&mdash;and
pass the plate often&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the South&rsquo;s perfect biscuit, while
a Yankee biscuit is fluffy and high
as your Grandmother&rsquo;s comforter.
Westerners like sugar and spice....
New Yorkers have a fondness for
the old-world flavor of cheese.</p>
<p>But thick or thin, sweet or tangy,
the best biscuits the country over
are light and tender biscuits&mdash;perfectly
leavened biscuits.</p>
<p>Calumet, the modern Double-Acting
Baking Powder, will show
you the way to biscuits light as
air, delicately brown and tender.
And on pages <a href="#Page_19">19</a> to 20 are tested
Calumet recipes, based on Calumet&rsquo;s
marvelously economical proportion,
for any type of biscuit you
prefer to make and serve.</p>
<p>There is an extra touch of perfection
in every quick bread made
with Calumet. Muffins are tender,
evenly risen, free from humps and
from tunnels. Waffles, griddle
cakes, cookies, gingerbread, all owe
a new quality and sureness to Calumet&rsquo;s
Double-Action. Read on
and see just how it works!</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CALUMET&rsquo;S DOUBLE-ACTION</span>
<br /><i class="smaller">What it means to your baking!</i></h2>
<h3 id="c3">First Action</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Just enough leavening in
the mixing bowl</i></p>
</div>
<p>See Calumet&rsquo;s First Action. It begins in
the mixing bowl when you add liquid
(milk, water, or eggs) to the dry ingredients.
The instant liquid is added, things
begin to happen. Thousands of tiny gas
bubbles surge through the batter, making
it light and spongy and ready for baking.
BUT&mdash;only part of Calumet&rsquo;s leavening
gas is released in the mixing bowl....</p>
<h3 id="c4">Second Action</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />
<p class="pcap"><i>&mdash;just enough leavening
in the oven</i></p>
</div>
<p>Calumet&rsquo;s Second Action is released by
heat. See what happens in the oven. Steadily,
evenly, hundreds of new tiny bubbles
swell through the batter and continue the
leavening. Up! ... up! ... they keep
raising the batter and hold it high and
light. Thanks to these two scientifically
balanced actions, Calumet Baking Powder
protects your baking from start to finish.</p>
<hr />
<p>Baking powder is a small part of any given recipe, yet it plays such
an important role that it is often called &ldquo;the biggest little thing in
baking&rdquo;. Too much or too little baking powder or baking powder that is
not efficient ... what a lot of baking trouble that can cause! Humped,
uneven cakes ... dry, harsh, coarse-grained cakes ... even flat failures!</p>
<p>Calumet&rsquo;s two leavening actions are perfectly timed and balanced to
give maximum protection and superb quality to all your baking. A little
of this Double-Acting Calumet does a superfine job&mdash;and this means
extra economy for Calumet users. The usual Calumet proportion is 1
level teaspoon per cup of sifted flour. This amount is only one-half to
two-thirds the amount recommended for many other baking powders.</p>
<p>Most of the recipes in this book call for this proportion. In some
recipes, however, the number of eggs, the type of flour, or the nature
of other ingredients make advisable slightly more or slightly less. But
every recipe has been tested again and again and has been carefully
built with exactly the right proportions to give you the full advantage
of Calumet&rsquo;s Double-Action. Follow these recipes accurately, faithfully,
and rejoice in the efficiency and economy of Calumet.</p>

batter for three quick desserts&mdash;a real Miracle Cake.</p>
<p class="revint">1. Mix Calumet batter, pour in pan; cover
tightly, first with a damp cloth, and then
with waxed paper. Tie securely.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Store batter in a cold place until you are

will be held in reserve until the batter
reaches the heat of the oven.</p>

</div>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Do</i> be orderly. Plan your baking before you start. Choose your
recipe, read it through carefully, understand it clearly. Collect
all the ingredients specified, and arrange them in the order
called for in the recipe; assemble all the utensils needed on
your work table. Cultivate the do-it-right habit.</p>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Do</i> use good ingredients. You can&rsquo;t do first-rate baking with
second-rate materials. Use fresh, sweet shortening and eggs of
fine quality. Use fine granulated sugar, unless some other kind
is called for in your recipe. Remember that baking powder
and flour are the most important ingredients in baking. Give
yourself the protection and advantages of Calumet, the
Double-Acting Baking Powder ... and of Swans Down Cake
Flour, too, whenever the recipe calls for it. It gives to cakes
and to certain quick breads a fineness and lightness that you
cannot expect from ordinary flour.</p>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Don&rsquo;t</i> use more Calumet than the recipes call for. Calumet&rsquo;s Double-Action
gives it extra efficiency&mdash;less of its leavening gas is lost
from the surface of batters during mixing. Thousands of tests
have proved that the small amounts of Calumet Baking Powder
specified in these recipes will give you best results. One
level teaspoon of Calumet to a cup of sifted flour is the correct
proportion for most recipes. In some recipes the nature
of the ingredients makes advisable slightly more or slightly less.</p>

&frac34;; on the other, to read &#8531; and &#8532;. A standard tablespoon is
equivalent to 3 standard teaspoons. Always sift flour once
before measuring, and remember that all standard measurements
are <i>level</i>.</p>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Do</i> mix carefully. Follow exactly the mixing directions given in
each recipe. The way you combine and handle your ingredients
is important.</p>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Do</i> use the type and size of pans specified in the recipes, and prepare
your pans before mixing. A greased paper lining in pans
for large butter cakes gives added protection.</p>
<p class="revint"><i class="b large">Do</i> handle cakes carefully, after baking. Place butter cake and
pan on cake rack, for about 5 minutes; then remove from
pan, and turn cake, top side up, on rack to finish cooling. For

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
